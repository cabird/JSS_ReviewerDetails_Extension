# JSS Reviewer Details Chrome Extension
A Chrome extension to show reviewer details in the assigned papers table for the JSS website

This extension loads the details for all reviewers of each paper in the table view for assigned papers.  
It can be useful for editors of the Journal of Systems and Software as they manage multiple papers in 
various phases of the review process. I found it tedious to open the details for each paper just to 
see what the decisions were, who was late, or how many reviews were completed.  This extension pulls 
data from each paper's details page and integrated it into the main assigned papers table.  See screenshot 
for an example.  Submit questions, bugs, pull requests, and feature requests here.
